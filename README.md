# RecreationalSportsApp

This app was created to allow users to create groups and manage those groups within the app. Users are able to invite others users to their groups and create events for those groups. The app was created using a relational SQL backend, the bulma.io css framework, and was developed using VSCode. This app was built to showcase working knowledge of databases, frameworks, and web development best practices.

Below are a few screenshots and assisting photos to showcase the final project.
